              Dennis Juma began his journey in tourism in 2013, building extensive knowledge
              through years of guiding wildlife safaris, mountain hiking expeditions and cultural
              tours. He is trained in Management by the <strong>Kenya Institute of Management</strong>,
              and professionally trained by the <strong>Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)</strong> in
              wildlife conservation — giving him strong grounding in responsible tourism,
              environmental protection and visitor safety.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-foreground/85">
              With this solid foundation, Juma Adventures has successfully guided guests through
              iconic destinations such as the Masai Mara, Amboseli, Tsavo, Lake Nakuru, Serengeti,
              Ngorongoro and challenging mountain adventures including Mount Kenya and Mount
              Kilimanjaro.
